            <h1>Suzuki Motor Corporation</h1>
            <p>The Suzuki Motor Corporation is a Japan based company which is focused nowadays in cars and motorcycles production. At the beginning, in 1909, Suzuki started with weaving looms production and then only from 50's started with cars. It took less than sixty years for the Japanese company to become the tenth producer in the world of four-wheel vehicles: thanks to compact and reliable cars that have conquered many customers.<br>The first car produced by the Japanese company is the 1955 Suzulight: front-wheel drive, independent four-wheel suspension and a 360 cc engine capable of generating 16 hp. This model is enough - later also available in the van variant - to bring Suzuki in second place among the Japanese manufacturers of four-wheeled vehicles, behind the Honda.</p>
            <h2>Year by year: Suzuki's growth</h2>
            <p>Suzuki's automotive business in the 1970s suffered a setback due to the brand's difficulty in complying with the US anti-pollution regulations. In 1975 models began to be produced outside Japan - to be precise in Pakistan - while in 1979 it was the turn of the first generation of the Alto city car.<br><br>In 1981 General Motors bought 5.3% of the Japanese brand's shares and announced a partnership with Isuzu for the production of new small cars. In the same year the heir of the LJ made his debut, known by us as SJ and Samurai.Two other agreements take place in 1982 when Suzuki creates Maruti (which began its activity in 1983, the year in which the first Swift generation is launched) with the help of the Indian government and allies with the Spanish brand Santana to be able to sell their off-road vehicles in Europe by bypassing the quota set in the Old Continent for "made in Japan" vehicles. In 1984 the SJ was equipped with a more powerful 1.3 engine and in 1988 an SUV was launched capable of seducing many motorists: the Vitara.</p>
