            <h1>Suzuki Motor Corporation</h1>
            <p>The <b>Suzuki Motor Corporation</b> is a Japan based company which is focused nowadays in cars and motorcycles production. At the beginning, in 1909, <b>Suzuki</b> started with weaving looms production and then only from 50's started with cars. It took less than sixty years for the Japanese company to become the tenth producer in the world of four-wheel vehicles: thanks to compact and reliable cars that have conquered many customers.<br>The first car produced by the Japanese company is the 1955 <b>Suzulight</b>: front-wheel drive, independent four-wheel suspension and a 360 cc engine capable of generating 16 hp. This model is enough - later also available in the van variant - to bring Suzuki in second place among the Japanese manufacturers of four-wheeled vehicles, behind the Honda.</p>
            <h2>Year by year: Suzuki's growth</h2>
            <p>In 1958 on all <b>Suzuki</b> the stylized "S" is still used as a logo, while in 1965 it was the turn of the compact front <b>sedan</b>. The Japanese brand began producing off-road vehicles in 1970: the <b>LJ10</b> is equipped with a two-cylinder 360 cc engine with 21 hp and is less than three meters long.Suzuki's automotive business in the 1970s suffered a setback due to the brand's difficulty in complying with the US anti-pollution regulations. In 1975 models began to be produced outside Japan - to be precise in <b>Pakistan</b> - while in 1979 it was the turn of the first generation of the <b>Alto</b> city car.<br><br>In 1981 <b>General Motors</b> bought 5.3% of the Japanese brand's shares and announced a partnership with Isuzu for the production of new small cars. In the same year the heir of the <b>LJ</b> made his debut, known by us as <b>SJ</b> and <b>Samurai</b>. Two other agreements take place in 1982 when <b>Suzuki</b> creates <b>Maruti</b> (which began its activity in 1983, the year in which the first <b>Swift</b> generation is launched) with the help of the Indian government and allies with the Spanish brand Santana to be able to sell their off-road vehicles in Europe by bypassing the quota set in the Old Continent for "made in Japan" vehicles. In 1984 the <b>SJ</b> was equipped with a more powerful 1.3 engine and in 1988 an SUV was launched capable of seducing many motorists: the <b>Vitara</b>.<br><br>The 90's opened up for <b>Suzuki</b> with the signing of an agreement that allowed the Japanese brand to start producing vehicles from 1992 in Hungary. In 1998, GM increased its share of the Japanese brand to 10%.<br><br>In 2000, <b>GM</b> acquired 20% of Suzuki shares and in 2003 - the year in which a partnership was signed with Fiat for the development and production in <b>Hungary</b> of the <b>SX4</b> and <b>Sedici SUVs</b>, launched in 2006 - the "made in Japan" brand won for the thirtieth consecutive year, the national record for sales in the “kei car” segment (small cars - such as the <b>Wagon R +</b> - highly appreciated in the Land of the Rising Sun for fiscal, practical and insurance reasons).<br>The second generation of the <b>Suzuki Swift</b>, launched in 2004, appeals to the Japanese and European public. In 2009, on the occasion of the centenary of the brand, <b>Volkswagen</b> purchases 20% of the brand's shares (abandoned in the meantime by <b>GM</b>): the agreement does not work and ends already in 2011. In the same year the US branch closes its doors: too many small cars in a market that demands larger models, strong yen and too stringent safety regulations.</p>
